ExportScene03
	ExportScene03/main.cxx, the custom classes MyFbxMesh and MyFbxObject are defined in 
	ExportScene03/MyFbxMesh.h. These classes respectively inherit from FbxMesh and FbxObject.

	Custom User Data for Layer Elements - in ExportScene03 refer to the CreateCubeWithMaterialAndMyFbxMesh() function. 
	This function creates a custom compound based on float and boolean data types, 
	and adds data for each vertex.

// get all meshes in a scene
You can get all the objects of a certain type in a scene using the concept of connections. In the following code snippet, we iterate through the meshes connected to a scene by calling lScene->GetSrcObjectCount(FbxMesh::ClassId).
for(int i = 0; i < lScene->GetSrcObjectCount(FbxMesh::ClassId); i++) {
    FbxMesh* lMesh = (FbxMesh*)lScene->GetSrcObject(FbxMesh::ClassId, i);
    //...
}
